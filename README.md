# FAIR Data Hackathon Bio-IT World 2019

Materials for the hackathon in April 2019, for the section hosted by [Collaborative Drug Discovery](http://collaborativedrug.com): **BioAssay Express: Applying FAIR Principles to Bioassay Protocols** (see [site](https://www.bio-itworldexpo.com/fair-data-hackathon)).

This part of the hackathon event is about evaluating journals to see how well they adhere to guidelines for describing their experiments completely, according to the following schemes:

* NextGen Sequencing
* MIARE: Minimum Information About an RNAi Experiment
* MIFlowCyt: The Minimum Information About a Flow Cytometry Experiment
* MIQE: Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments
* MISFISHIE: Minimum information specification for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments

To make this work, we are customizing an instance of BioAssay Express - [https://fair.bioassayexpress.com](https://fair.bioassayexpress.com) with new templates for each of these categories. We will be using the tool to annotate as many literature protocols as we can, and at the end of the day, we will find out how well they are doing!

In addition, the BioAsssay Express API can now be explored using SmartAPI [http://bioassayexpress.smart-api.info/](http://bioassayexpress.smart-api.info/).
